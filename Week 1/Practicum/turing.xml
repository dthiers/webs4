Thus what is true        for one Turing machine is true for all Turing machines no matter how        implemented.   </definition>   <definition>    <name>      <last_name>Turing</last_name>    </name> was also an accomplished    <profession>mathematician</profession> and    <profession>cryptographer</profession>.
